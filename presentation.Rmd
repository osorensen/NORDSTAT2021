# Latent Variable Models

Multiple observations measure a latent trait, e.g.

- Cognitive abilities follow from responses to different tests.

- Attitudes measured by responses to survey questions.

Classical tools

  - Factor analysis
  
  - Item response theory
  
  - Structural equation models.

# Lifespan variation is smooth and nonlinear
Parametric models not well suited to capture such curves.

# Semiparametric Latent Variable Models

Example: California verbal learning test of episodic memory

  - Five trials at a single test session.
  
  - Latent episodic memory seems to depend smoothly on age.

# Generalized Additive Latent and Mixed Models


---

# General Framework

- A combination of generalized additive mixed models<sup>1</sup> and generalized linear latent and mixed models<sup>2</sup>.

- Multilevel models with components varying at $L$ levels. $\boldsymbol{\eta}^{(l)}$ denotes a vector of latent variables varying at level $l$, and the vector of all latent variables belonging to a given level-2 unit is

$$\boldsymbol{\eta}_{j} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{\eta}_{jk\dots z}^{(2)}{}^{'},
\boldsymbol{\eta}_{k\dots z}^{(3)}{}^{'},
\dots,
\boldsymbol{\eta}_{z}^{(L)}{}^{'}
\end{bmatrix}'$$

# Part 1: Response Distribution

Elementary units of observation distributed according to an exponential family.

$$f\left(y_{i} | \theta_{i}, \phi\right) = \exp\left\{\frac{y_{i}\theta_{i} - b\left(\theta_{i}\right)}{\phi} + c\left(y_{i}, \phi\right)  \right\}$$




All responses are stacked in the vector $\mathbf{y} = (y_{1}, y_{2}, \dots, y_{n})'$. Often the responses can be of completely different types, so dummy variables are used extensively in the regression models.


---

# Part 2: Measurement Model

Linking the observed responses to latent variables $\eta_{m}^{(l)}$ of interest.

$$\nu_{i} = \sum_{s=1}^{S} f_{s}\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right) + \sum_{l=2}^{L}\sum_{m=1}^{M_{l}} \eta_{m}^{(l)} \mathbf{z}^{(l)}_{mi}{}^{'}\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{m}^{(l)}$$

- Hierarchical model with $L$ levels. Each level $l$ has $M_{l}$ latent variables. Factor loadings $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{m}^{(l)}$ link the latent variables to the observed measurements.

- Related to confirmatory factor analysis: $\mathbf{y} = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}\boldsymbol{\eta}$.

--

Smooth functions $f_{s}(\cdot)$, e.g., 

$$f_{s}\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right) = \sum_{k=1}^{B_{s}} \omega_{ks} b_{ks}\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right), ~ s=1, \dots, S.$$

with weights $\omega_{ks}$ constrained by some smoothing penalty.



---

# Part 3: Structural Model

Structural model

$$\boldsymbol{\eta}_{j} = \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\eta}_{j} + \mathbf{h}\left(\mathbf{w}_{j}\right)+ \boldsymbol{\zeta}_{j}$$

- $\mathbf{B}$ contains regression coefficients between latent variables.

- $\mathbf{h}\left(\mathbf{w}_{j}\right)$ are smooth functions describing how the latent variables depend on explanatory variables.

- Related to structural equation models: $\boldsymbol{\eta} = \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\eta} +\boldsymbol{\Gamma}\mathbf{w}+ \boldsymbol{\zeta}$.




---

# Mixed Model Representation

- Spline smoothing mathematically equivalent to fitting mixed models <sup>1</sup>.

- Lets us represent GALAMM as a nonlinear mixed model

$$E\left(y\right) = g^{-1}\left(\nu\right) = f\left(X, \beta\right) + Z\left(\beta\right) \eta, ~~~ \eta \sim N(0, \Psi)$$

- Can fit it with a profile likelihood approach, utilizing efficient mixed model software (`lme4`/`nlme`).

- We use this to derive asymptotic covariance matrices for all functions and parameters.

# Applications

# Episodic Memory

![](figures/cvlt_sample_plot.png)

# Episodic Memory

Measurement model for elementary unit $i$:

$$\nu_{i} = \underbrace{\mathbf{d}_{ti}'\boldsymbol{\beta}_{t}}_{\text{test version}} + \underbrace{d_{ri}\beta_{r}}_{\text{retest effect}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{d}_{ti}'\boldsymbol{\lambda}}_{\text{factor loading}}\sum_{l=2}^{3} \underbrace{\eta^{(l)}}_{\text{latent level}}$$

In words:


- Linear predictor for the probability of answering correctly on the test is a function of some covariates as well as the true latent level of episodic memory.


---

# Episodic Memory


Structural model for level-2 unit $j$:

$$\boldsymbol{\eta}_{j} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\eta_{jk}^{(2)} \\
\eta_{k}^{(3)}
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
h\left(w_{jk}\right) \\
0
\end{bmatrix} 
}_{\text{smooth fun. of age}}
+
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
\zeta_{jk}^{(2)} \\
\zeta_{k}^{(3)}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\text{random intercepts}}$$

For a given participant:

- $\eta_{jk}^{(2)}$ is the latent level of episodic memory at a given timepoint. It consists of a smooth function of age and a random intercept across tests at the given timepoint.

- $\eta_{k}^{(3)}$ is the random intercept of episodic memory across timepoints.

---

# Episodic Memory

Reduced form model

$$\nu_{i} = \mathbf{d}_{ti}'\boldsymbol{\beta}_{t} + d_{ri}\beta_{r} + h\left(w_{jk}\right) \mathbf{d}_{ti}'\boldsymbol{\lambda} + \zeta_{jk}^{(2)}\mathbf{d}_{ti}'\boldsymbol{\lambda} + \zeta_{k}^{(3)} \mathbf{d}_{ti}'\boldsymbol{\lambda}$$

is actually a nonlinear mixed model.

# Episodic Memory

# Episodic and Working Memory

Important question in cognitive neuroscience: 

- How is change in cognitive performance correlated across cognitive domains?


We extended the previous model to a factor-by-curve model, with some items measuring working memory and others measuring episodic memory.

- Math is in the paper.


---

# Episodic and Working Memory

Density plot (right) obtained with empirical Bayes posterior sampling.

![](figures/cvlt_dspan_figure.png)

The estimated correlation between random intercepts was 0.41. Hence, people's episodic memory and working memory are positively correlated.

# Another Application

# Socioeconomic Status and Hippocampus

- Hippocampus is a brain region which plays an important role in memory consolidation, and is one of the first regions to be damaged in Alzheimer's disease. 

- It has been suggested that low socioeconomic status is bad for development of the hippocampus, and hence is a risk factor for dementia.

# Socioeconomic Status and Hippocampus

Data from 4196 MRI scans of 1886 participants.

---

# Socioeconomic Status and Hippocampus

- We defined socioeconomic status (SES) as a latent variable measured by income and education level.

- Latent covariate model, with response $y_{i}$ constructed by stacking income, education, and hippocampal volume:


$$y_{i} = \mathbf{d}_{\text{s},i}'\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\text{s}} + d_{h,i}\left\{ \mathbf{x}_{\text{h},i}' \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\text{h}} + f\left(a_{i}\right)\right\} +  \eta_{1}^{(2)} \mathbf{z}_{i}' \boldsymbol{\lambda} + d_{\text{h},i} \eta_{2}^{(2)} + \epsilon_{i}$$



Research question:

  - How does socioeconomic status $\eta_{1}^{(2)}$ interact with the lifespan hippocampal trajectory $f(a_{i})$?
  


---

# Socioeconomic Status and Hippocampus

Conclusion:

- 95% CIs for both the offset effect and the interaction effect contained zero. Hence, not much evidence for an effect of socioeconomic status on hippocampal volume in these data.

# Summary

# Summary

- Generalized additive latent and mixed models allow multilevel latent variable modeling when the latent variables themselves depends smoothly on one or more observed covariates.

  - R package: https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/galamm
  
  - Extensive simulations suggest that asymptotic covariance matrices are highly accurate with moderate sample sizes.

- Further work

  - Develop faster algorithms tailored to typical applications, which also allow mixed response types.
  
  - All smooth functions to depend on latent variables.
